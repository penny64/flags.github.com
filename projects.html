<p class="post-title">.Reactor 3</p>
<div class="post">Location: The Zone, an irradiated area surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, where a devastating incident caused the fourth reactor to completely self-destruct in 1986. In an alternate timeline, the third reactor caught fire shortly after the initial destruction, sending another wave of radiation through the Zone, corrupting all surrounding life. The city of Pripyat was abandoned immediately following the first incident, forever freezing the city in time.</div> 
<div class="post">Fast-forward: It's 2016. Rumors of invaluable goods retrieved from the Zone start to fill the darker corners of society, and a curiosity builds inside of those looking for fame and fortune. Enter you: down on your luck and looking for a way back to the top, you head to the Zone with the intention of doing whatever it takes to make a living from selling the artifacts.</div>
<div class="post">Reactor 3 is still a very young project, but it is now <a href="https://github.com/flags/Reactor-3">open source</a>. You can track its development <a href="http://flagsdev.tumblr.com">here</a>.</div>
