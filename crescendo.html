<h1>Crescendo</h1>

<p>I thought it would be a good coding excercise to write a peer-to-peer filesharing program. It turned out to be a bit easier than I expected, and I found a lot of ways around the limitations I was expecting to encounter.</p>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>With each instance of Crescendo, both a client and server "node" are created. A search for other nodes on the network is then run, and the client connects to each one. The running node then communicates with nodes connected to a client, and a mesh-like network is created.</p>

<h2>What Works?</h2>

<p>Right now? Everything. An actual UI is next.</p>

<h2>"Isn't this a waste of time?"</h2>

<p>It was a programming excercise I created for myself. I've learned quite a bit by doing it, and I plan to finish it.</p>
