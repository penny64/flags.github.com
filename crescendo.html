<h1>Crescendo</h1>

<p>I thought it would be a good coding excercise to write a peer-to-peer filesharing program. It turned out to be a bit easier than I expected, and I found a lot of ways around the limitations I was expecting to encounter.</p>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>With each instance of Crescendo, both a client and server "node" are created. A search for other nodes on the network is then run, and the client connects to each one. The running node then communicates with nodes connected to a client, and a mesh-like network is created.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flags/Crescendo">Source</a></p>

<p>Win32 binaries will be available at some point.</p>

<h2>What Works?</h2>

<p>Right now? Everything. An actual UI is also included for those more comfortable with GUIs.</p>

<p>It was a programming excercise I created for myself. I've learned quite a bit by doing it, and I plan to finish it.</p>

<h2>Packets</h2>

<p>In order for the client or node to accept an incoming packet, the following format must be used:</p>

<pre><code>command::variable::value\r\n
</code></pre>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>There are only two valid terms that can be used in the command portion of the packet: get and put.</p>

<p>'get' -requests information from the server or client.
'put' -sends data to the server or client.</p>

<h2>Variables</h2>

<p><code>hnd</code> -Handshake. First required packet when connecting. Sent by node.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
The `value` field must be the security method used by the node. A value of `error` means the handshake was dropped.
</code></pre>

<p><code>pwd</code> -Password. Required by private networks only.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
A string must be passed to value. However, only private networks will check this. Required by nodes. Nodes will respond with a value of "okay" if the password is correct.
</code></pre>

<p><code>inf</code> -Info. Final stage of connecting. Requests info from the node, which responds with a dictionary containing several variables.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
The client does not need to send a value. Anything is accepted by the node. Nodes will respond with a value containing a dictionary that needs to be run through the json module. Broadcast nodes will also include a list of all nodes being broadcasted.
</code></pre>

<p><code>fil</code> -File. Requests a file. Value must be a valid filename that is being shared by the node.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
`get`: The client must send this command repeatably until the entire file is received. The client drops to raw mode until the file is downloaded. Pings/Broadcasts are also stopped for this transaction (other clients will not notice, however.) A `fie` packet is then sent, telling the the node to restart pings/broadcasts to this client and to reset various file-related things. 
`put`: The node must send this command repeatably until there are zero bytes to read.
</code></pre>

<p><code>fie</code> -File end. The client sends this when there are no bytes left to read.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
The `fie` portion of the packet speaks for itself. A random or empty value can be sent.
</code></pre>

<p><code>fib</code> -File error. Sent by the node when an error occurs with the file.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
Speaks for itself. Garbage data is needed for a value.
</code></pre>

<p><code>bro</code> -Broadcast. The client can send this to the node to request a spot on its broadcast list. If so, the node responds with "okay."</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
`put`: Clients can send this to apply for a spot on the node's broadcast list. Value must be `host:ip`.
`put`: Nodes send this after a client has been added to the broadcast list.
</code></pre>

<p><code>pin</code> -Ping. Used to make sure connections are still going through to a client/node.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
`put`: Clients respond with this. Value should be garbage data.
`get`: Nodes send this to request a ping from a client. Garbage value.
</code></pre>

<p><code>fli</code> -File list. Not to be confused with <code>fil</code>. Requests a file list from the node.</p>

<pre><code>Usage:
`put`: Nodes send this in response to `get`. Must be a JSON'd list of files. See crescendo_server.py for info. Should send a value of `okay` when nothing is left to be sent.
`get`: Asks node for the file list. Value is the point in the node's filelist you want to start at. The node should respond with 32 entries starting from that point.
</code></pre>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>Files can only be sent one at a time. If a node tries to send a file that is currently being sent to another client, only a part of the file will be sent.</li>
</ul>
