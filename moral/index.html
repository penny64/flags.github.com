<h1 class="post-title">moRaL: ASCII Violence</h1>
<div class="post">Roguelikes require the player to be tactical, calculating, and - (arguably) most importantly - lucky, which makes moRaL the anti-roguelike roguelike, exchanging turn-based tactics for pseudo-realtime gameplay where the player's actions often take place over a number of turns instead of instantly. The mentality is this: make stats an afterthought, weapons passive, include elements of persistence, add unusual enemy types, humor, violence, weird gimmicks, and some unknown evil lurking underneath. With these things combined, moRaL is an unusual - and sometimes unsettling - take on the roguelike genre.</div>
<h1 class="post-title">Development</h1>
<div class="post">moRaL is currently closed-source and undergoing development privately. Sorry!</div>
