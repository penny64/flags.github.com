		<p style="margin-right: 2px;">If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I've always wanted to develop games, and if there's just one more thing I'm sure of, it's that I've always wanted to program. Marrying these two ideas, I can say that being a game developer has been my dream since I was a kid. </br></br>

Growing up on the NES and later becoming enamored with Freeware games on the PC, I formed a deep appreciation for both the design and implementation of games, setting out to create my own as early as the 4th grade using Clickteam's "The Games Factory." I picked up GameMaker 6 and its C-like language two years after that.</br></br>

Without regular access to the Internet, I developed game after game, self-teaching myself design patterns I would apply years later when I decided to make game development my career.</br></br>

Fast-forward: I've developed a handful of games that represent my desire to create ambitious games that take risks, which you can read about here. I have a long history with Python, but found its limitations were preventing me from doing exactly what I wanted to do - I now develop my games in C, which gives me the level of control I sorely missed in other languages.</br></br>

I'm serious about making games that innovate and take risks. If you feel the same, we should talk.</p>

		<p style="margin-left: 2px;">Launched along with the revelation of <i>Reactor 3</i> in 2012, flagsdev existed solely to attach a name to a project. Over a year of development later, <i>Reactor 3</i> was canceled after its third redesign, and focus was changed to prototyping unique game mechanics. Many prototypes later, flagsdev emerged with the concepts that would later power <i>Insurgence: Shadow Operation</i>, a tactical, squad-based shooter,
		and <i>TORCH!</i>, a puzzle roguelike featuring a unique lighting mechanic.</p>
