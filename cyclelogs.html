<h1>cyclelogs.py</h1>

<p>cyclelogs.py was written to manage my ~/.logs/ folder,
which acts as the dumping ground for logs that my various scripts write to.
However, <a href="logtime.html">logtime.py</a> had an issue with calculating time differences between days,
so the need for rotating logs became apparent.</p>

<p>There might already be a script out there that does this, but I like writing my own, and this
is cross-platform.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Python 2.4+*</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note: I have not tested with 2.4, but that's the first version that included the subprocess module.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>If you're on a Windows machine, the 'mv' variable must be changed to something like "copy".
Actually, I have no idea, because Windows really does suck for these things. I suggest
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/341950/belvedere-automates-your-self+cleaning-pc">Belvedere</a>, because
it works pretty well.</p>

    _time = time.strftime(timeformat)
    _outfile = '%s.%s' % (infile,_time)

    subprocess.call([mv, infile, _outfile])

            _fname = os.path.join(root, infile)
            #print _fname
            cycle(_fname)

if len(sys.argv)==2:
    if sys.argv[1][len(sys.argv[1])-1] == os.sep: cycleall(sys.argv[1])
    else: cycle(sys.argv[1])
