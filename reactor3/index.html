<h1 class="post-title">What is Reactor 3?</h1>
<div class="post">Reactor 3 is a game about survival. More so, it bridges the gap between the likes of NETHACK, FALLOUT, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. while introducing roguelike elements. Featuring a procedurally generated world filled with intelligent AI that mangage needs, form relationships, create factions, and start conflicts, Reactor 3 aims to create an immersive experience not previously seen in the roguelike genre.</div>
